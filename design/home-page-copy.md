**Your real friends. Real gatherings. No noise.**

Your social media friend list is full of people you met once and never saw again. But somewhere in that crowd are the people who matter—the ones you actually spend time with.

Party is a space for them. A human-scale community focused on what matters: bringing your real friends together.

## What is Party?

Party cuts through the noise of social media to focus on genuine connection. It's not another place to scroll or another invitation to ignore.

When you join Party, you're automatically on the list for events. No reaching out. No asking. Just real gatherings with people you actually know.

## Philosophy

**Human scale.** You can't have a billion friends, or even a thousand. Party embraces this reality.

**Alive and minimal.** A design that feels analogue, not algorithmic. Simple, efficient, and focused.

**Open, but backwards.** Entry isn't an invitation to reach out—it's an automatic invitation to show up.
