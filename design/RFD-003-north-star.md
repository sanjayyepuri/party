## Problem Statement

My friend list on social media has become heavily diluted. This means there are many people that I have never spent time with -- folks I had met once and never had the time or opportunity to reach out again. 

This huge group of people has faded from memory. But I have an amazing community of friends who I do spend a meaningful amount of time with. It's these people I want to create a space for -- a place where the noise of media and all of its distractions disappears that focuses on facilitating real community interaction. 

This community will be open, but the entry will be backwards. It's not an invitation to reach out. It's an automatic invitation to events I will host.


## Approach

This community is human scale. I can't have a billion friends, let alone a 1000. The space will be small. It will focus on a design philosophy that feels alive, analogue and minimal. The implementation will reflect this -- simple and efficient.
