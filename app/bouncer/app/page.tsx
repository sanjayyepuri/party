        My friend list on social media has become heavily diluted. This means
        there are many people that I have never spent time with -- folks I had
        met once and never had the time or opportunity to reach out again.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">
        This huge group of people has faded from memory. But I have an amazing
        community of friends who I do spend a meaningful amount of time with.
        It's these people I want to create a space for -- a place where the
        noise of media and all of its distractions disappears that focuses on
        facilitating real community interaction.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">
        This community will be open, but the entry will be backwards. It's not
        an invitation to reach out. It's an automatic invitation to events I
        will host.
